## SpeedFont

> SpeedFont lets you declare fonts on your site through CSS without having to manually import them.

Platforms such as Google Fonts and Font Library require you to create a new stylesheet with a path to the desired font before you can even begin to declare it.

This can take up a lot of time when it comes to testing out different fonts - especially those that you have not yet imported.

SpeedFont imports all declared fonts for you.

It's completely free to use and you can send as many requests as you like.
